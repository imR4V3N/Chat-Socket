# Chat-Socket

### Java Project - Chat under Socket:

The project consists of a socket-based chat system in Java, integrating messaging functionality between multiple clients managed by a server. Here is an overview of the main features **:**

1. **Chat between customers managed by a server** : Clients can connect to the server and exchange messages in real time with other connected clients.
2. **Multi-threading support** : The server is capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously thanks to a multi-threaded model.
3. **Limit on the number of connected clients** : The server may limit the number of clients that can connect simultaneously to ensure optimal performance.
4. **Private messaging** : Customers have the ability to send private messages to another specified customer, ensuring confidentiality of exchanges.
5. **Sending text files to server** : In addition to text messages, clients can also send text files to the server to share documents.
6. **Java Swing Technology** : The client GUI is developed using the Java Swing library, providing a friendly and interactive user interface.

In summary, this project offers a real-time communication platform with messaging, multiple connection management, private messaging and text file sharing features, all implemented in Java with a Swing user interface.

The project was developed on visual studio code using the Java 17 language
